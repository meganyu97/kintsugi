i come from a broken history 
one where i believed the only thing my shards could fit into was a mosaic, forever disjointed 
or a stained glass window, where sunlight would allow me to bring joy to otherâ€™s lives, but stormy days caused the world to pass by with no regard
eventually my burdens became too heavy for my aching heart
and i thought the only next step was for my skeleton to be ground to powder
so that i could get high off my fault lines and forget my past
but i have discovered the art of kintsugi 
for centuries, the japanese have been repairing broken ceramics with golden seams
creating pieces so beautiful, not because of their pure indigeneity,
but because their imperfections show resilience, 
and the cracks are not seen as fault lines,  
but as what makes the piece uniquely brilliant
